# NBA-shots

## Business Understanding:
Taking and making shots late in the shot clock is an important aspect of an NBA game. In many cases the team can't generate a good shot and relies on a star player in those stressful times to bail them out. Here, I look dtata from the 2014-2015 NBA season. It includes many information (player taking the shot, closest defender distance, the shot clock, etc.). I eliminate the data outside of the late shot clock (<20 s), identify the players taking the most shots, and provide more insights.

## Data Understanding:

Libraries needed: Python, Pandas , matplotlib, numpy, sklearn

NBA_shots.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the entire code, how the data is treated and analyzed

script.py: Python scrip (similar to the jupyter notebok)

shot_logs.csv: Data log 

The outcome shows many NBA centers, not traditionally critical for the offense, are taking an alarming number of shots late in the shot clock.
